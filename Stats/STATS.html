<h1> Statistics </h1>

<p> In the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Winona State University, statistics majors will 
benefit from a wide variety of features, including:

Small class size: The average size of a statistics class in our department is only 37 students. This 
means you get the teacher-student interaction you need to ensure success.
Computational resources: Knowing how to use statistical software is critical to becoming a successful 
statistician. In our department, you will have access to and learn to use a wide variety of 
computational tools used by professional statisticians. This includes programs such as JMP, SAS, R, and 
SPSS.
Dedicated teachers: The statistics faculty at Winona State are here to make sure you not only succeed, 
but have fun doing so!
Experiential learning: Field trips are frequent to help statistics majors discover their specific 
interests. Recent learning experiences include trips to Trane Industries, Mayo Clinic, and Target. These 
visits often result in internships for our majors.
Graduate school visits: Our majors are strong candidates for any reputable graduate program in 
statistics or biostatistics. We take annual visits to regional graduate schools so students can explore 
their options. Recent visits include Iowa State University, University of Minnesota, and University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. </p>
