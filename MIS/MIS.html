<h1> Management Information Systems </h1>
<p>The Management Information Systems program enables students to learn how to integrate technology into 
business processes to improve system efficiency and effectiveness. MIS students take general business 
courses such as accounting, finance, marketing, economics, statistics, and project management, but 
additionally take coursework such as programming, databases, networking, information systems, 
information technology and ecommerce in order to learn how these disciplines support modern businesses. 
Graduates of the Management Information Systems program pursue careers as programmers, business 
analysts, technical or network support personnel, systems analysts, web developers, database analysts 
and account managers. </p>

<p>An MIS major is of interest to students who wish to specialize in business-orientated information 
analysis and data processing. This curriculum provides a broad overview of computer based information 
systems, with special emphasis on business applications and managerial control. An MIS professional 
utilizes tools, techniques, and concepts of various disciplines such as computer science and management 
science. These interdisciplinary tools combined with an understanding of the basic needs of an 
organization enable the information system professional to apply computer technology to the solution of 
a wide range of business problems. Frequently information systems professionals interact with 
individuals in the functional areas of an organization to analyze information needs and requirements and 
to serve as a liaison with computer systems personnel.</p>
